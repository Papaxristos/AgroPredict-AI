# AgroPredict-AI

AgroPredict AI - README Description
AgroPredict AI is an advanced tool designed for agronomists and researchers to analyze and predict the nutrient needs (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) of agricultural fields. By leveraging machine learning and visual data analysis, this project enables optimized fertilizer application tailored to specific field conditions.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Insights: Utilizes pre-trained models to predict N, P, and K requirements based on crop data.
Field Visualization: Provides an intuitive color-coded map indicating areas of nutrient deficiency:
Red for Nitrogen
Green for Phosphorus
Blue for Potassium
Comprehensive Analytics: Includes a bar chart summarizing nutrient needs as percentages across the field, ensuring a holistic understanding of fertilizer demands.
Field Image Integration: Displays the original field image alongside nutrient-specific visualizations for easy comparison and analysis.
Workflow:
Input field data and pre-trained model results.
Load the aerial or field image of the plot.
Generate predictions and visualize them over the field image.
Obtain actionable insights into the nutrient distribution across the field.
Benefits:
Reduces overuse or underuse of fertilizers, promoting sustainable agriculture.
Saves time by automating nutrient need analysis.
Enhances crop productivity through precise nutrient management.
This project is a valuable resource for data-driven decision-making in modern farming. Whether you're an agronomist, researcher, or farmer, AgroPredict AI empowers you to optimize agricultural practices efficiently and effectively. ðŸŒ±
